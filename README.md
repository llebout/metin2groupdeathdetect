# Metin2 Group Death Detect

Static hosted version: https://llebout.github.io/metin2groupdeathdetect/

## How it works 

It only compares the value of some saved pixel locations on the screen every second, if they change, it plays a sound. The project itself can be reused for any purpose that requires checking then alerting if a pixel at some location changed, not only Metin2.

## Is it a cheat?

Debatable, the project seems sufficiently non-invasive with the game to not be considered as one, furthermore it is a web page that works inside a web browser with no permissions whatsoever on the computer, it is merely an help so that when you are in front of your computer or around it that you get alerted about something that requires your human action which you still indeed come to do to act upon the alert. So in that regard for me it's not. In my opinion it can be compared to the aid that some other websites provide to better play and win more of the games from the METIN2 events like Chase the king, Okey, etc.
